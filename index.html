            <h2>It's a me, Mario</h2>
            <p>Back in the mid-1980s, I was thrilled to unwrap a hi-tech gift for my ninth birthday:
                 a handheld Game + Watch version of the arcade hit Donkey Kong. 
                 I played the game obsessively, captivated by its split screen liquid-crystal 
                 display, and the simple expressiveness of its hero character: a plucky monochrome 
                 figure called Mario, who would scale a construction site to rescue a captive princess. Mario had three lives in this platform game, but an apparently infinite appeal beyond it.
                 Over the decades, Mario has appeared in more than 200 games, among them Nintendo's 
                 original Mario Bros (which marks its 40th anniversary in March 2023), alongside his 
                 sibling Luigi, and the Mario Kart series (1992 onwards). His adventures have inspired multi-generational merch (toys, trading cards, designer kimonos), spin-offs including new animated feature The Super Mario Bros Movie, and theme park attractions. More than any other video-gaming character, Mario has steadily powered up 
                 from an arcade sprite to a household name and pop culture icon.

        <p>Mario's now massive "every man" presence stems from low-key beginnings. 
            Prior to his 1981 debut in Donkey Kong, Mario had been called Ossan 
            (Japanese for "middle-aged guy"), Mr Video and Jumpman in development; 
            he was eventually named after the landlord of Nintendo's US HQ. His creator, 
            Shigeru Miyamoto, referenced global pop culture influences, envisioning a 
            protagonist that could make recurring cameos across different games, rather 
            like Alfred Hitchcock cropping up in the movies he directed. Mario's original 
            8-bit design was instantly recognisable: stout, bright, bearing a distinctive cap and moustache; by the arcade release of Mario Bros (1983), his character was adapted, switching roles from carpenter to Italian-American plumber (reflecting that game's landscape of pipes, as well as Miyamoto's love of Western comics), 
            while the controls remained intuitive..
